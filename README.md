# Techfest
Welcome to the **Temperature Alert Application** repository! This README provides instructions on how to set up the project locally, create a virtual environment, and install the required dependencies.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- Python (3.x recommended) installed on your local machine.

## Local Setup

To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:

   Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/yourproject.git
   ```

   Replace the URL with the actual URL of this repository.

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**:

   Change your working directory to the project's directory:

   ```bash
   cd yourproject
   ```

3. **Create a Virtual Environment (Optional but Recommended)**:

   It's recommended to work within a virtual environment to isolate project dependencies. Create a virtual environment using the following command:

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   ```

4. **Activate the Virtual Environment**:

   Activate the virtual environment based on your operating system:

   - On Windows:
     ```bash
     venv\Scripts\activate
     ```

   - On macOS and Linux:
     ```bash
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```

5. **Install Dependencies**:

   Use `pip` to install the project's dependencies listed in the `requirements.txt` file:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   This command will install all the required packages, including Flask and other project-specific dependencies.

6. **Configure Environment Variables (if needed)**:

   If the project relies on environment variables, create a `.env` file in the project directory to store them. Update the variables as needed for your local environment.

7. **Run the Flask Application**:

   Start the Flask application using the following command:

   ```bash
   flask run
   ```

   By default, the Flask app will run on `http://localhost:5000`. Open a web browser and navigate to this address to access your locally running Flask application.

8. **Access Your Application**:

   Open a web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5000` (or the address specified by Flask). You should see your Flask application running locally.
